        <p>
          Hello, I'm Nico! I am a front-end developer with a background in art,
          photography, and design. I have spent the last several years working
          in technology education, and I am looking to get back to my design and
          development roots.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am based in Maryland, and in my spare time I enjoy getting outside
          and spending time in nature. When the weather refuses to cooperate, I
          like to spend time indoors crafting, reading, or learning new
          programming skills.
        </p>
