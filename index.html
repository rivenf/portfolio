          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello, I'm Nico! I am a front-end developer with a background in art, photography, and design. I have spent the last several years working in technology education, and I am looking to get back to my design and development roots.</p>
          <p>I am based in Maryland, and in my spare time I enjoy getting outside and spending time in nature. When the weather refuses to cooperate, I like to spend time indoors crafting, reading, or learning new programming skills.</p>
